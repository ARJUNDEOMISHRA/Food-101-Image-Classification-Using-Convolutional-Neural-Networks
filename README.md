# Food-101-Image-Classification-Using-Convolutional-Neural-Networks


## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on **multi-class food image classification** using the
**Food-101 dataset** and **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** implemented
with **TensorFlow and Keras**.

The model is trained to recognize different food categories from images by
learning visual patterns such as texture, color, and shape.
